# 8. Write a program that checks if a year is a leap year.

try:
    year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

    if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
        print(f"{year} is a leap year")
    else:
        print(f"{year} is not a leap year")

except:
    print("Enter a valid input")
